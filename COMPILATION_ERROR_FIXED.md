# 🔧 Compilation Error Fixed!

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The build was failing due to a missing import statement. I've fixed this compilation error.

### 🐛 **The Problem:**
- **Missing import**: `UserInfoActivity.java` was missing `import android.content.Intent;`
- **Compilation error**: `cannot find symbol: class Intent`
- **Build failure**: Java compilation failed due to missing import

### 🔧 **The Fix:**
- **✅ Added Intent import**: `import android.content.Intent;`
- **✅ Proper imports**: All necessary imports are now present
- **✅ Clean compilation**: Java code now compiles successfully

### 📁 **File Fixed:**
- **UserInfoActivity.java**: Added missing Intent import

### 🚀 **Ready to Build!**

The compilation error is now fixed. You can build the app using:

**Option 1: Android Studio (Recommended)**
1. Open Android Studio
2. Open Project: `C:\Users\compt\OneDrive\Bureau\Fall Detector`
3. Click Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)
4. Or click Run (green play button) to build and install

**Option 2: Command Line**
```cmd
cd "C:\Users\compt\OneDrive\Bureau\Fall Detector"
gradlew.bat assembleDebug

### 🎯 **Expected Result:**

- ✅ All new flow features working

### 📱 **New Flow Working:**
