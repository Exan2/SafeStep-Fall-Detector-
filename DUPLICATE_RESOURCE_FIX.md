# 🔧 Duplicate Resource Error Fixed!

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The build was failing due to duplicate resource names. I've fixed this issue.

### 🐛 **The Problem:**
- **Duplicate resources**: Both `onboarding_1_illustration_png.png` and `onboarding_1_illustration_png.xml` existed
- **Android build error**: Cannot have two resources with the same name
- **Build failure**: Resource merger couldn't handle the duplicates

### 🔧 **The Fix:**
- **✅ Removed duplicate XML file**: Deleted `onboarding_1_illustration_png.xml`
- **✅ Kept PNG files**: Your actual illustrations are preserved
- **✅ Clean resource structure**: No more duplicate names

### 📁 **Current Resource Structure:**
```
app/src/main/res/drawable/
├── onboarding_1_illustration_png.png ✅ (your illustration)
├── onboarding_2_illustration_png.png ✅ (your illustration)
├── onboarding_3_illustration_png.png ✅ (your illustration)
├── emergency_illustration_png.png ✅ (your illustration)
└── (other drawable files...)
```

### 🚀 **Ready to Build!**
